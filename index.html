                        <h2>How often should I change my aquarium's water?</h2>
                        <p class="aside-text">You should change about 15 to 25% of your aquarium’s water every one to two weeks. When you change your aquarium’s water, you should clean the rest of the tank as well. The percentage of water and frequency of water changes depend on the volume of fish and plant life in your tank. A heavily stocked tank will need a larger volume of water changed more frequently, and a lightly stocked tank can be changed slightly less. Changing the water in your tank is the most important maintenance you can perform on your aquarium, so following a regular schedule will greatly benefit the health and quality of life of your marine life.</p>
                        <h2>Aquarium maintenance schedule</h2>
                        <p class="aside-text">Following a maintenance schedule will prevent your aquarium from becoming overly dirty or hazardous to your fish’s health. This schedule should consist of daily, weekly, and monthly tasks.</p>
                        <h2>Daily aquarium maintenance</h2>
                        <h3>You can keep your tank's water clean by performing these simple tasks everyday:</h3>
                        <ul class="daily-maint-list">
                            <li>Ensure all pumps, filters, and lights are working properly</li>
                            <li>Observe fish for negative side effects. If any side effects are evident, test the water immediately. If the water is fine but the fish remain ill, check the filters and pumps for any malfunctions.</li>
                            <li>Top of the water tank.</li>
                            <li>Check the water's temperature, it should remain between 75° and 80° Fahrenheit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Weekly aquarium maintenance</h2>
                        <p>Every one or two weeks, you should clean your fish tank and replace no more than 25% of your tank’s water.</p>

                        <p>Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes from the subfamily Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae. The largest can reach a length of 17 cm (6 & 1⁄2 in), while the smallest barely achieve 7 – 8 cm (2 & 3⁄4 – 3 & 1⁄4 in).</p>
                        <p>Anemonefish are endemic to the warmer waters of the Indian Ocean, including the Red Sea, and Pacific Ocean, the Great Barrier Reef, Southeast Asia, Japan, and the Indo-Malaysian region.</p>
                        <p>While most species have restricted distributions, others are widespread. Anemonefish typically live at the bottom of shallow seas in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons.</p>

                    <p>Fishman had a passion for the drums from an early age and emulated John Bonham, the drummer for Led Zeppelin, Bill Bruford of Yes and King Crimson, along with Keith Moon of The Who. He went to Jamesville-Dewitt High School in a suburb of Syracuse.</p>
                    <p>After graduation in 1983, he attended the University of Vermont to study engineering. Shortly after his arrival, he met Mike Gordon and Trey Anastasio and founded the band Phish. Deciding against engineering, he and Anastasio transferred to Goddard College</p>

                    <h2 class="fish-name">Billy Bass</h2>
                        <p>Billy Bass is an American novelty manufacturing company, best known for its animatronic and inflatable characters. It is currently headquartered in Coppell, Texas. Billy Bass eventually ventured into novelty manufacturing, and in 2000, it achieved marketing success with the Big Mouth Billy Bass.</p>
                            
                        <p>Following that success, the company began predominantly making animatronic figures focused on the Christmas and Halloween seasons. The company distributes product internationally, especially to the United Kingdom. The fish is made of latex rubber with an internal plastic mechanical skeleton.</p>
                        <p>The mounted fish turns its head, wiggles its tail on the trophy plaque, and sings cover songs, such as "Don't Worry, Be Happy" (1988) by Bobby McFerrin; and "Take Me to the River" (1974) by Al Green. Green claims he received more royalties from Big Mouth Billy Bass than from any other recordings of the song.</p>
                        <p>The singing mechanism was originally activated by a motion sensor and was designed to startle a passerby. Eventually, a button was added to activate it. There have been many variants of Big Mouth Billy Bass produced by Billy Bass. These use different types of game fish and aquatic animals. Variants include: Travis the Singing Trout, Cool Catfish, Rocky The Singing Lobster, and Lucky The Lobster.</p>
